# Website1

Testing the Creation of a website using Jekyll templates,
Funnily enough made after Website2, which was used to test and initially upload file hosting, which was auto routed as a page on the subdomain of my personal website ( website being 'github.fryhop.com' and the auto Hosted/routed thing I found cool was 'github.fryhop.com/Website2/' and all files just continued under that extention.)
Worth noting that add-on site name are case sensitive in that 'github.fryhop.com/website2/' will give a 404 page, but 'github.fryhop.com/Website2/' gives the desired site.
File uploads are obv case sensitive
the primary & sub domain ('fryhop.com' & 'github.fryhop.com') capitalization didn't seem to matter ('GITHUB.FRYHOP.com/' or 'GiThUb.FrYhOp.com/' will all take you to 'github.fryhop.com/')
